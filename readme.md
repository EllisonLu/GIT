Repo for trying out git and gitHub

## What is git?
git is a **Version control** software. It  maintains different versions of our code/project as well as a history of the changes.

## what is a commit?
In git a **commit* is a checkpoint of the changes we made in our project. We can review all previous commits and revert back to any point in time we want to. It's important to put clear **commit** messages, so you know what changes had occurred there.

## what is a branch?
A branch is a different verison of our code that cones from a certain commit. Changes that occur on a seperate branch dont't effect the main or any other branches. They're independant until they are marged into other branches.
