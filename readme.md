## What is git?
git is a **Version control** software. It  maintains different versions of our code/project as well as a history of the changes.

## what is a commit?
In git a **commit* is a checkpoint of the changes we made in our project. We can review all previous commits and revert back to any point in time we want to. It's important to put clear **commit** messages, so you know what changes had occurred there.
